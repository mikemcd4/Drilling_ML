# Predicting Drilling Outcomes with Machine Learning

## Overview

We will be utilizing supervised machine learning to predict how successful and efficient a drilling well will be, with efficiency/success determined by rate of penetration, or how far the well drills in feet per hour.

## Communication Protocols

We will be utilizing slack, as well as Zoom to communicate and collaborate with each other. We will also be sharing notes via Google Docs.
